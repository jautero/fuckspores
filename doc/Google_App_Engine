title: Google App Engine Fuckspore App

## Description

First I will try to implement Fuckspores in Google App Engine. Since there is no other implementation, it will have to implement all parts. Main page will contain list of fuckspores you have subscribed to on the left and status updates from those fuckspores on the right. On top there is text box for your status update. Each account will have single public profile page for the user and single public feed for his status updates

## Backlog

* As a user I want to be able to login so that only I can edit my fuckspore
* As a user I don't 
* As a user I want to share URL of my fuckspore so my friends can find me.
* As a user I want the fuckspore URL be as clear as possible so that I can share it using post-its or 
* As a user I want to add image to fuckspore.
* As a user I want to add name to fuckspore.
* As a user I want to add feeds and other URLs to my fuckspore.

* As a user I want my tools to easily find the machine readable format of my fuckspore.
* As a user I want to add my friend's fuckspores to a list
* As a user I want to follow my friend's feeds through their fuckspores.
