title: Google App Engine Fuckspore App

## Description

First I will try to implement Fuckspores in Google App Engine. Since there is no other implementation, it will have to implement all parts. Main page will contain list of fuckspores you have subscribed to on the left and status updates from those fuckspores on the right. On top there is text box for your status update. Each account will have single public profile page for the user and single public feed for his status updates

## Backlog
* [[BLI1]]As a first time visitor I want fuckspores front page to describe what it is all about. 
* [[BLI2]]As a user I want to be able to login so that only I can edit my fuckspore
* As a user I don't want to have a Google account because I don't trust Google.
* As a user I want to share URL of my fuckspore so my friends can find me.
* As a user I want the fuckspore URL be as clear as possible so that I can share it using post-its or speach.
* As a user I want to add image to fuckspore so that people can identify me.
* As a user I want to add name to fuckspore so that people know who's fuckspore it is.
* As a user I want to add feeds and other URLs to my fuckspore so that I have single page to aggregate my social media.
* As a user I want to have machine readable form of my fuckspore so that I can take advantage of that aggregation.
* As a user I want my tools to easily find the machine readable format of my fuckspore so that I can just point my tools to my fuckspore URL.
* As a user I want to add my friend's fuckspores to a list so that I have single page on which to find them.
* As a user I want to follow my friend's feeds through their fuckspores.
* As a user I want to have easy way to add new feeds to my fuckspore.
* As a user I want to connect other identities and not just URLs to my fuckspore
