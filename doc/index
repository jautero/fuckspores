Platforms based on open standards are better than platforms based on single provider. There already are tools and standards for distributing status information called feeds.  FSpores are based on open industry standards like RSS and Atom with maximum interoperability and minimum lock-in.

Goal is to create a simple standard way to describe your profile, aggregate different social network applications into that profile and create web services for maintaining that profile and using it to aggregate status reports from different sources to create your own news feed.

## Architecture

To implement basic functionality of Facebook news feed, you need three services. One to maintaining the fuckspores themselves as profile pages, one to generate feed for fuckspore from your status updates and one for displaying items from fuckspore feeds in a single news feed. [[Google App Engine]] is page for Google App Engine implementation of these.

### Profile page

This will be the first component.

### News Page

## File Formats

* [[Simple Format]]
* [[XML Format]]

## Features

* Standard way to represent profile data
* Tools for maintaining that profile ([[Profile Page]])
* Way to aggregate status reports from different services (Twitter, Facebook, Fourspace, LiveJournal, Wordpress etc.)
* Tools to aggregate status reports from multiple entities.

## Applications

### FSporeLike

Copy of Facebook's like feature. Basically you can add like button on any page that displays number of likes. You can log into page and set following privacy settings:
* URLs you like is tracked with cookie and public information 
* URLs you like is tracked with cookie, but only shown to you
* URLs you like is tracked with cookie that is not connected to your account
* No tracking cookie

### FSporeWall

### FSporeIdentity

Use identities (like OpenID) connected to your FSpore to authenticate your FSpore. Actually you can connect any authentication method by simply setting `(name,value)` pairs in FSpore. `openid=http://jautero.livejournal.com/` or `googleaccount=jautero@gmail.com`.
